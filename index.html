          First of all welcome to the website AND The Colony.
          The guy you hear talking in every video is Man of the Antz or Mantz for short.<br>
          <br>
          He owns the Oculus rift and Touch which is why most gameplays are VR games.
          Some are quick looks at interesting titles other are let's plays on longer story based games <br><br>
          Anything goes on the Oculus so he'll be playing through shooters, RPGs, horror games, strategy games, and everything between.<br>
          He will be doing some series for some non-VR games as well, as and when they take his fancy.
          That will mainly revolve around strategy & simulation games such as Planet Coaster, Cities Skylines,
          and Farming Simulator. There are also a video AND stream wednesday at 6pm UK time (UTC/GMT)<br><br>
          If you wanna see anything particular let him know in the comments or on the discord<br>
          (links to social media are given at the Home and Messages page as either an icon or button)
          <br>
