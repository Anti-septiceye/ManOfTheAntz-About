        <p>
          First of all welcome to the website AND The Colony. <br>
          The guy you hear talking in the videos is Man of the Antz or Mantz for short.<br>
          <br>
          He owns the Oculus rift and Touch which is why most of the channel is VR content. <br>
          Some are quick looks at interesting titles other are let's plays on longer story based games <br>
          <br>
          Anything goes on the Oculus so he'll be playing through shooters, RPGs, horror, strategy, and everything in between.
          <br>
          He will be doing some series for some non-VR games as well, as and when they take his fancy. <br>
          That will mainly revolve around strategy & simulation games such as Planet Coaster, Cities Skylines,<br>
          and Farming Simulator. Saying that, if something does crop up this will likely expand to: <br>
          shooters, RPGs or action games!
          <br>
          He also does a video AND stream wednesday at 6pm UK time (GMT)<br>
          <br>
          If you wanna see anything particular let him know in the comments or on the discord<br>
          (link is given at the home- and Messages page as an icon or button)
