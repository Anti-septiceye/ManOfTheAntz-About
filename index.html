    <h1>About Mantz</h1>
    <h3>On this page you will be told about Mantz.</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>The reason this page is here is so you can get to know mantz a little bit without having to watch too many of his videos.<br>
    Some people might find this unhelpful or unneeded and we will keep trying to improve but we of course can't make it perfect immediately.<br>
    That is why tips are always welcome on Discord to (Anti-SepticEye or Mantz) or on github.com. But now on to the subject: Man Of The Antz (Mantz for short).</h5>
    <p> This will have the information but I wanted approval first</p>
